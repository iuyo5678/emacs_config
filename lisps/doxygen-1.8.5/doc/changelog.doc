\subsection log_1_8_4 Release 1.8.4
\htmlonly
<b>(release date 19-05-2013)</b>
<a name="1.8.4"></a>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>   id 686384: When INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS is enabled, also structs with
       simple typedefs will be inlined.
<li>   Doxywizard: scrolling with mouse wheel no longer affects the values in
       the expert view.
<li>   id 681733: More consistent warnings and errors.
</ul>
<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
<li>   Added support for "clang assisted parsing", which allows
       the code to also be parsed via libclang (C/C++ frontend of LLVM) 
       and can improve the quality of the syntax highting, cross-references, 
       and call graphs, especially for template heavy C++ code. To enable 
       this feature you have to configure doxygen with the --with-libclang 
       option. Then you get two new configuration options: CLANG_ASSISTED_PARSING 
       to enable or disable parsing via clang and CLANG_OPTIONS to pass additional 
       compiler options needed to compile the files. Note that enabling this feature 
       has a significant performance penality.
<li>   Included patch donated by Intel which adds Docbook support.
       This can be enabled via GENERATE_DOCBOOK and the output location can
       be controlled using DOCBOOK_OUTPUT. Docbook specific sections can be
       added using \docbookonly ... \enddocbookonly
<li>   Added support for UNO IDL (interace language used in Open/Libre Office), thanks to
       Michael Stahl for the patch.
<li>   Included patch by Adrian Negreanu which stores data gathered by 
       doxygen in a sqlite3 database. Currently still work in progress and
       can only be enabled using --with-sqlite3 during ./configure.
<li>   For interactive SVG graphs, edges are now highlighted when hovered by
       the mouse.
<li>   Include patch by Adrian Negreanu to show duration statistics after a run.
       You can enable this by running doxygen with the "-d Time" option.
<li>   Included patch by Markus Geimer which adds a new option 
       LATEX_EXTRA_FILES which works similarily to HTML_EXTRA_FILES in that
       it copied specified files to the LaTeX output directory.
<li>   id 698223: Added support for C++11 keyword alignas
<li>   id 693178: Added support for processing DocSets with Dash (thanks to
       Bogdan Popescu for the patch 
<li>   id 684782: Added option EXTERNAL_PAGES which can be used to determine
       whether or not pages importated via tags will appear under related 
       pages (similar to EXTERNAL_GROUPS).
<li>   id 692227: Added new MathJax command MATHJAX_CODEFILE which supports
       including a file with MathJax related scripting to be inserted before
       the MathJax script is loaded. Thanks to Albert for the patch.
<li>   id 693537: Comments in the config file starting with ## will now be 
       kept when upgrading the file with doxygen -u (and doxygen -s -u).
       Thanks to Albert for the patch.
<li>   id 693422: Adds support for Latvian (thanks to a patch by Lauris).
<li>   Included language updates for Ukrainian, Romanian, and Korean

<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>   Changed to way the search results for multiple projects can be linked 
       together. A project is now no longer identified by the tag files name but
       via new option EXTERNAL_SEARCH_ID giving a bit more flexibility.
<li>   Disabled the disk cache for member data. Allows removing quite some complexity
       in doxygen and is not really needed now that 64bit systems with &gt;4GB RAM 
       are becoming more common. Let me know if you think you benefit from this caching.
<li>   id 691607: Using $relpath$ in a custom footer could lead to ambiguities
       when followed by a name that could also be a marker, like 'search'.

\subsection log_1_8_2 Release 1.8.2
\htmlonly
<a name="1.8.2"></a>
<b>(release date 11-08-2012)</b>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>   Using a fenched block (~~~~) in Markdown without explicit extension will 
       now be interpreted as a @code..@endcode block instead 
       of @verbatim..@endverbatim.
<li>   Classes inheriting from an class that is outside the scope of doxygen
       are still shown in diagrams. This does not hold for usage relations.
</ul>
<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
<li>   Added support for C++11:
       <ul>
       <li> strongly typed enums, e.g.:
            <pre>enum class E</pre>
       <li> enums with explicit type, e.g.: 
            <pre>enum E : unsigned int { ... }</pre>
       <li> id 678097: added support for final keyword on classes and methods.
       <li> support for override keyword for methods.
       <li> <code>nullptr</code> is new a type keyword in code fragments.
       <li> support for variables with initializer lists, 
         e.g.: <pre>const int var {10};</pre>
       <li> support for trailing return types, 
         e.g.: <pre>auto foo() -&gt; Bar;</pre>
       <li> id 672372: added support for template aliases, 
         e.g.: <pre>template&lt;typename T&gt; using A = B&lt;T&gt;;</pre>
       <li> support for C++11 variadic templates, 
         e.g.: <pre>template&lt;typename... Values&gt; class C;</pre>
       <li> support for documenting template class declarations.
       <li> id 680098: <code>static_assert(...);</code> inside a class is now ignored.
       <li> id 679740: Add support parameters with default lambda functions, 
         e.g.:  <pre>int foo(int i, std::function&lt;int(int)&gt; f = [](int x) -&gt; int { return x / 2; })</pre>
       <li> default initializers for non-static data members, 
         e.g.:  <pre>class C { public: int x = 4; int y {6}; int z = y*func(); };</pre>
       <li> support for decltype as a way selecting a type for a variable, 
         e.g.: <pre>int x; decltype(x) y;</pre>
       <li> support for new string literals, 
         e.g.  <pre>u8"utf8", u"utf-16", U"utf-32", L"wchar"</pre>
       <li> support for raw string literals (with and without user defined 
         delimiter), 
         e.g.  <pre>R"(some"thing)", u8R"raw(some)"thing)raw"</pre>
       <li> support for explictly deleted and defaulted special members 
         (<code>=default</code> and <code>=delete</code>).
       </ul>
<li>   Made several improvements to the way Objective-C categories and protocols 
       are handled:
       <ul>
       <li> Class extensions are now treated as part of the class, whereas 
         categories are listed separately.
       <li> Fixed parse problem where category had a { } section.
       <li> Fixed parse problem for categories that implemented protocols.
       <li> Fixed render bug for protocols in class diagrams.

         cross reference links are made between these members.
       <li> Class extension implementing protocols are now shown as protocols
         inherited by the class itself, including the "Implemented by" relation.
       </ul>
<li>   Added option HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET which allows adding an additional
       stylesheet without completely replacing doxygen.css.
<li>   Added option AUTOLINK_SUPPORT which can be used to enable/disable
       autolinking globally.

\subsection log_1_8_0 Release 1.8.0
\htmlonly
<a name="1.8.0"></a>
<b>(release date 25-02-2012)</b>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>   Auto list items can now consist of multiple paragraphs.
       The indentation of the (first line) of a new paragraph detemines
       to which list item the paragraph belongs or if it marks the end of the
       list. 
<li>   When UML_LOOK is enabled, relations shown on the edge of a graph
       are not shown as attributes (conform to the UML notation)
<li>   Updated the manual and improved the look.
<li>   Made the contents in the navigation tree more consistent for
       groups, pages with subpages, and grouped subpages.
<li>   id 669079: Latex: made the margins of latex page layout smaller using 
       the geometry package.
<li>   The tool doxytag has been declared obsolete and is removed
       (it wasn't working properly anyway). Same goes for the installdox 
       script.
<li>   Updated the copyright in source code and doxywizard "about" to 2012.
<li>   id 668008: HTML version of the manual now has the treeview enabled
       for easier navigation.
</ul>
<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
<li>   Added support for 
       <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
       formatting.
       This is enabled by default, but can be disabled by 
       setting MARKDOWN_SUPPORT to NO. When enabled the following is 
       processed differently:
       <ul>
       <li> tabs are converted to spaces according to TAB_SIZE.
       <li> blockquotes are created for lines that start with one or more &gt;'s
            (amount of &gt;'s detemine the indentation level).
       <li> emphasis using *emphasize this* or _emphasis this_ or
            strong emphasis using **emphasis this**. Unlike classic
            Markdown 'some_great_indentifier' is not touched.
       <li> code spans can be created using back-ticks, i.e. `here's an example`
       <li> Using three or more -'s or *'s alone on a line with only spaces
            will produce a horizontal ruler.
       <li> A header can be created by putting a ===== (for h1) or ----- (for h2)
            on the next line or by using 1 to 6 #'s at the start of a line
            for h1-h6.
       <li> auto lists item can also start with + or * instead of only -
       <li> ordered lists can be made using 1. 2. ... labels.
       <li> verbatim blocks can be produced by indenting 4 additional spaces.
            Note that doxygen uses a relative indent of 4 spaces, not an
            absolute indent like Markdown does. 
       <li> Markdown style hyperlinks and hyperlink references.
       <li> Simple tables can be created using the <a href="http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/#table">Markdown Extra format</a>.
       <li> <a href="http://freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/Fenced_Code_Blocks">Fenced code blocks</a> are also supported, include language selection.
       <li> files with extension .md or .markdown are converted to related pages.
       </ul>
       See the section about Markdown support in the manual for details.
<li>   It is now possible to add user defined tabs or groups of tabs to
       the navigation menu using the layout file (see the section of the manual
       about customizing the output for details).
<li>   Added new command \tableofcontents (or [TOC] if you prefer Markdown)
       which can be used in a related page with sections to produce a 
       table of contents at the top of the HTML page (for other formats the
       command has no effect).
<li>   When using SVG images and INTERACTIVE_SVG is enabled, a print icon
       will be visible along with the navigation controls to facilitate 
       printing of the part of the graph that is visible on screen.
<li>   Added obfuscation of email addresses for the HTML output to make
       email harvesting more difficult.
<li>   Added build targets for 64 bit Windows (thanks to Vladimir Simonov).
       The installer script is also updated to install a 64 bit version of
       doxygen on 64 bit systems and the 32 bit version on 32 bit systems.
<li>   Added support for using the HTML tag &lt;blockquote&gt; in comments.
<li>   Included patch by Gauthier Haderer that fixes some issues with the
       dbus XML parser.
<li>   Added support for Markdown style fenced code blocks.
<li>   Added option to @code command to force parsing and syntax highlighting
       according to a particular language.
<li>   Section of pages are now added to the navigation index.
<li>   Added support for cell alignment and table header shading in
       LaTeX and RTF output. 
<li>   Added -d filteroutput option to show the output of an input filter
       (thanks to Albert for the patch).
<li>   id 668010: Latex: for Windows doxygen new generates a makepdf.bat
       file in the latex output dir to create the latex documentation.

<h1>Doxygen Release 1.7.3</h1>
<h2>(release date 03-01-2011)</h2>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>   Added a header for each HTML page above the navigation menu, 
       showing the project name and logo and a short descriptin (all optional).
       Disabling the index (with DISABLE_INDEX) still shows the new header
       (you can still customize this using HTML_HEADER). This now works
       nicely in combination with GENERATE_TREEVIEW = YES and/or
       SEARCH_ENGINE = YES.
<li>   Redesigned the treeview feature. Instead of using frames, the
       navigation tree is now loaded on each page dynamically. This allows
       bookmarking a page and always keeps the top menu visible. Also the
       current item is automatically highlighted in the tree.
       Also updated the icons in the treeview to match the overall look'n'feel.
       Note: if you now use a custom HTML header, please update it using
       doxygen with the -w and the edit the default header.
</ul>

       which will be shown in the header of each HTML page along with
       the project name (PROJECT_NAME option).
<li>   Added option PROJECT_BRIEF which can be used to specify a brief
       description which will be shown in the header of each HTML page
       just below the project name.
<li>   Added new option FILTER_SOURCE_PATTERNS which can be used 
       in combination with FILTER_SOURCE_FILES to filter files used for 
       the source browser based on file extension, which can overwrite 
       the filter set by FILTER_PATTERNS and/or INPUT_FILTER.
<li>   Added new option STRICT_PROTO_MATCHING which is disabled by default,
       and makes the parameter matching to be less strict, resulting in 
       fewer "No matching class member found" warnings.
</ul>
