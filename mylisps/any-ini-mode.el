;;; Commentary:

;;; When a file is visted in <any>.ini mode the _valid_ section and parameter names
;;; are highlighted as keywords, the comments are highlighted as comments and everything 
;;; else is displayed in your normal font. 

;;; The list of valid section and parameter names is built dynamically, based on a 
;;; canonical file ('source of truth') that contains all valid options.

;;; In this way, you can easily spot a mis-typed name when you're editting your files, 
;;; rather than having to wait for your application to misbehave.

;;; It's also useful if, like me, you have users who can't spell 'log_file_path' or
;;; colleagues who insist on creating parameters called 'defaulttofirstbackupdirectory'.

;;; You may also define, among other things, a valid comment character and a
;;; valid assignment charcter.

;;; Collectively, the definition of a canonical file and a comment character etc 
;;; define a 'style' of .ini file.
;;;
;;; You may set up a default style for all <any>.ini mode buffers, or, more usefully,
;;; you may set up several styles that will be automatically applied, based on the name
;;; of the file being visited.

;;; any-ini-mode now includes support for `imenu'.
;;;
;;; `imenu-generic-expression' is set up for each buffer to find the section names
;;; and, by default, a menu of section names is automatically added to the menubar.
;;;
;;; If you setup `speedbar' correctly, this means that you can also navigate the 
;;; sections with `speedbar'.
;;;
;;; See the `any-ini-imenu' customization group and the documentation for `imenu'
;;; and `speedbar' for more details.

;;; Finally, you may want to try running the `any-ini-toggle-errorcheck-mode' command.
;;; See the docstring for this command for an explantion.

;;; Customization is via the `any-ini' group in the `local' customization section.

;;;
;;; To load any-ini-mode on startup, copy this file to your load-path and add this to 
;;; your .emacs file -
;;;
;;;    (require 'any-ini-mode)
;;;
;;; You may also want to specify that <any>.ini mode should apply by default
;;; to all .ini and .conf files, for example. Here's how -
;;;
;;;    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(".*\\.ini$" . any-ini-mode))
;;;    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(".*\\.conf$" . any-ini-mode))
;;;

;;; Example:
;;;
;;; You deal with three applications - larry, mo and curly.
;;; Each requires a config file - larry.conf, mo.ini and .curlyrc - and none of the parameter
;;; names that are valid in a mo.ini file are valid in a larry.conf or a .curlyrc, etc. etc.
;;; 
;;; No problem.
;;;
;;; First, create a canonical config file for each app (the names of these files are unimportant).
;;; This is simply a template containing all the valid sections and parameters.
;;; eg.
;;;
;;; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; | # canon.larry.conf - canonical config file for the larry app                       |
;;; | # this file is maintained by the larry developers in ~devel/larry/etc              |
;;; | # Applies to larry v6.6.6 and up                                                   |
;;; | # Last updated 12-24-2001 by groucho                                               |

;;; | [USER]                                                                             |

;;; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;
;;; Next, create 3 styles (call them larry.conf, mo.ini and .curlyrc) in `any-ini-styles-alist' 
;;; and set the canonical file for each type.  You can also specify, for example, that a mo.ini
;;; uses `<' and `>' to bracket section names and that a .curlyrc uses `:' as its assignment 
;;; character.
;;;
;;; Finally, add this to your .emacs file -
;;; 
;;;    (require 'any-ini-mode) 
;;;    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(".*\\.ini$" . any-ini-mode))
;;;    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(".*\\.conf$" . any-ini-mode))
;;;    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.curlyrc" . any-ini-mode))
;;;

;;; Change Log:

;;; Changes from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4:

;;; * Improved doc strings for `any-ini-param-name-regexp' and `any-ini-section-name-regexp'
;;;   Based on feedback from Dave Pearson and others

;;; Changes from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3:

;;; * Fixed up for use with `describe-mode'.
;;;   Thanks to Vagn Johansen

;;; Changes from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2:

;;; * Add an `imenu' menu for section names
;;;   See `any-ini-setup-imenu' for details.

;;; Changes from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1:

;;; * Use new `any-ini-regexp-opt' function in place of standard `regexp-opt' function.
;;;   Necessary because of occasional memory problems with `regexp-opt' during parsing 
;;;   of very large (1500+ lines) files.

Files may be parsed in three ways, based on TYPE :

:is-canonical-file (nil)

The file will be treated as a canonical file.

It will be parsed twice, once to extract the section names and once
to extract the parameter names.

The section names will be extracted using `any-ini-section-start-chars',
`any-ini-section-name-regexp' and `any-ini-section-end-chars'.

The parameter names will be extracted using `any-ini-param-name-regexp'.
Parameter names will be extracted only if they are followed by an
assignment character (see `any-ini-assignment-chars'), possibly with
intervening whitespace. It is not necessary, however, for the parameters
to have any values assigned.

:is-list-of-section-names (1)

The file will be treated as a simple list of valid section names.
The first whitespace-delimited word on each line will be checked against
`any-ini-section-name-regexp' and those that pass will be extracted.

:is-list-of-paramter-names (2)

The file will be treated as a simple list of valid parameter names.
The first whitespace-delimited word on each line will be checked against
`any-ini-param-name-regexp' and those that pass will be extracted.

In all cases,  whitespace is ignored and `any-ini-comment-start-chars' is
