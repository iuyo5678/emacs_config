When enable, `semantic-stickyfunc-mode' shows the function point is
currently in at the first line of the current buffer. This is
useful when you have a very long function that spreads more than a
screen, and you don't have to scroll up to read the function name
and then scroll down to original position.

However, one of the problem with current semantic-stickyfunc-mode
is that it does not display all parameters that are scattered on
multiple lines. To solve this problem, we need to redefine
`semantic-stickyfunc-fetch-stickyline' function.
